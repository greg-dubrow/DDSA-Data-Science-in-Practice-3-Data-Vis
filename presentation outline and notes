Data visualization seminar – draft outline

1) Opening question – why makes charts? Why visualize data?
•	Do an interactive poll that shows a word cloud. Idea is to get following concepts highlighted among responses, Responses can be 1-4 words.
o	Information (examples: sports league tables, political polling charts)
o	Insights (examples: company dashboard in real time, annual / quarterly reports)
o	Persuasion (examples: research paper, data-driven blogs)

•	Ask about visual properties of word cloud - color, size, etc (setting in audience’s mind now some concepts that will come up later)

2) Kahoot or slido poll: choose most effective chart from a display of:
•	Plain line or bar chart, no annotation, title, axes without formatting
•	Line or bar chart with basic functional title, data legend to side
•	Line or bar chart with descriptive title, labels in data or set up in ways to maximize information delivery, annotated points to draw attention, tell story
•	Chart junk – 3d bar or something similar, messy

Explain research behind why some viz better than others.

3) Principles of data visualization – general design principles & elements

4) Principles of data visualization – grammar of graphics

5) Quick overview of tools used for data viz
•	R (ggplot), Python (seaborn), Tableau, Power BI, Datawrapper, Flourish, D3, Excel
•	Show Minard, DuBois, Nightingale, & Snow examples to show that dataviz was once ink/paint on paper

6) Building an effective chart demo
•	Live build a chart – make a bar or line plot, ask people to suggest a title and other enhancements.

7) Split into groups, build chart with dataset from World Happiness Report.
•	Groups split by preferred visualization tool? R, python, Tableau, Power BI?

8) Groups present charts – presentation format:
•	Group shows chart on screen
•	I ask audience what insight they see in the chart
•	Short discussion with chart group about what they intended to display vs what insights the audience took from the chart.

9) Q&A
